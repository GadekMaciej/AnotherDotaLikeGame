# About
This is a practice project which serves as sort of playground for implementing various multiplayer systems. Starting with main menu and a lobby system I plan to further hone my skills while adding new features. Currently I'm diping my toes in Epic Games shooter game example to learn the ropes of multiplayer programming.
