## GiantSpider

# About
This is a practice project which serves as sort of playground for implementing various multiplayer systems. Starting with main menu and a lobby system I plan to further hone my skills while adding new features. Currently I'm diping my toes in Epic Games shooter game example to learn the ropes of multiplayer programming.

# How to run
Project depends on [SuperGrid](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/supergrid-starter-pack) for tiling, you will have to download it manually and copy entire project folder `SuperGrid` inside `Content`.

Your Structure should look like this
```
